excerpt: "How the mundane moments of life often carry the most profound lessons."

This morning, I spilled coffee on my favorite shirt. 

It was one of those moments that could have spiraled – the rush to change, the frustration at the stain, the mental calculation of whether I had time to treat it before it set. But instead, I paused.

## The Pause That Changes Everything

In that pause, I remembered something my grandmother used to say: "Life happens in the spills and stains, not in the perfect moments."

She was right, of course. We spend so much time curating our lives, trying to avoid the messes, that we forget the messes are where the living happens.

## Grace in the Everyday

Grace isn't always found in grand gestures or profound revelations. Sometimes it's in:

- The way morning light catches dust motes dancing in the air
- The unexpected smile from a stranger on a difficult day
- The perfectly imperfect dinner shared with loved ones
- The coffee stain that reminds us to slow down

## The Practice of Noticing

I've started a practice of noticing these ordinary graces. Each day, I write down three mundane moments that held unexpected beauty or meaning. Yesterday's list:

1. The way my neighbor's cat stretched in the afternoon sun
2. Finding a forgotten $5 bill in my coat pocket
3. The sound of rain beginning just as I settled in with a book

These aren't Instagram-worthy moments. They won't make it into any highlight reel. But they're the threads that weave the fabric of a life well-lived.

## An Invitation to Notice

What ordinary moments in your life carry hidden grace? What would happen if you paused long enough to notice them?

The coffee stain on my shirt? It's still there. But now it's a reminder – a small, brown badge of a morning when I chose to see grace instead of frustration.

And that, perhaps, makes all the difference.
