excerpt: "Sometimes the most profound act of love is simply being present."

Last week, I sat with a friend in a hospital waiting room for six hours. We didn't talk much. We didn't need to.

## Presence Over Performance

We live in a world that values action, solutions, and fixes. When someone is hurting, we want to rush in with advice, remedies, and ten-step plans. But sometimes – often – what's needed isn't a solution. It's simply someone willing to sit in the uncertainty with us.

## What Showing Up Really Means

Showing up doesn't mean:
- Having the right words
- Knowing how to fix the problem
- Being comfortable with the situation
- Understanding what someone is going through

Showing up means:
- Being present when presence is hard
- Sitting with discomfort without trying to escape it
- Holding space for someone else's pain without making it about you
- Choosing to stay when leaving would be easier

## The Ministry of Presence

There's a sacred quality to simply being with someone. No agenda, no timeline, no expectation of outcome. Just presence.

I learned this from my mother, who would sit with grieving neighbors, never saying much, just being there. She'd bring a casserole, yes, but more importantly, she'd bring herself. Her presence said what words couldn't: *You're not alone. This matters. You matter.*

## The Courage to Show Up

It takes courage to show up without answers. Our culture doesn't prepare us for this. We're taught to be problem-solvers, advice-givers, fixers. But life's deepest wounds often can't be fixed – they can only be witnessed, held, and honored through presence.

## A Practice of Presence

This week, I'm challenging myself (and you, if you're willing) to practice showing up:

- For the friend who's struggling, without trying to fix them
- For the family member who's difficult, without trying to change them
- For ourselves, in our own pain, without trying to rush through it

## The Gift of Being There

In that hospital waiting room, as the hours stretched on, something shifted. The anxiety loosened its grip, just a little. Not because anything was solved or fixed, but because neither of us was alone.

Sometimes, that's all we can offer each other. And sometimes, it's everything.
